I recently saw a job posting that said "we value first-principles thinkers over pattern recognizers". This stuck with me; I find that I often make arguments by analogy ("$A$ is to $B$ as $C$ is to $D$"), which is really just pattern recognition. Does this mean I'm not qualified for this job?

According to Wikipedia, 

I'm not sure why pattern recognition gets a bad rap sometimes; I think it's not as sexy as first-principles thinking.

This got me to thinking: what's the distinction between pattern recognition

I think this is why experience is so valuable â€“ through experience, you learn to recognize patterns faster, and you've also encountered more types of patterns.

Thinking by analogy vs. "first-principles".
Experience = faster pattern recognition, seen more types of patterns.

I didn't apply for the job. I am a proud pattern recognition monkey.
