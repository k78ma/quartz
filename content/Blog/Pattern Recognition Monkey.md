I recently saw a job posting that said "we value first-principles thinkers over pattern recognizers". This stuck with me; I find that I often make arguments by analogy ("$A$ is to $B$ as $C$ is to $D$"), which is really just pattern recognition. Does this mean I'm not qualified for this job?

Thinking by analogy vs. "first-principles".
Experience = faster pattern recognition, seen more types of patterns.

I didn't apply for the job.
