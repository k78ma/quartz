## Mirage?
In Takehiko Inoue's manga *Vagabond*, the protagonist Musashi Miyamoto is single-mindedly driven by his desire to become strong. Not just strong, but the strongest – "Invincible under the Heavens" (天下無雙). Eventually, Musashi realizes that being the strongest is simply an empty title. When asked what it was like to be invincible by another swordsman, Musashi compared it to a mirage; you can see it so clearly from afar, but it fades when you get close.

My interpretation of this is that becoming good at something – in Musashi's case, the way of the sword – should not an end in and of itself.
## The Process
### The mortifying ordeal of being known
### Winner's games and loser's games`
In some sports, there's a concept of winner's games versus loser's games. Essentially, at different levels of aptitude, the win conditions are different – let's take the example of badminton. At low levels, all you really have to do to win is be more consistent than your opponent in hitting over the net and inside the court; you don't win by being better, you win by sucking less (loser's game). At high levels, everyone is consistent, so you win by hitting brilliant shots (winner's game).

I feel that this may be bit of a false dichotomy, but the point being raised here is applicable. A huge part of becoming good at things, or at least being better than others, seems to simply be consistency. I think this applies in two ways:
- Consistently showing up and putting the work in. 
- Solidifying basics (i.e. consistently hitting over the net and inside the court).

But the problem with this is its lack of sexiness. Not many people watch sports to see someone win by being more consistent – people want to see brilliant shots. The same goes for the participant; its much more enticing to work on brilliant shots and fancy technique rather than grind out the fundamentals.
