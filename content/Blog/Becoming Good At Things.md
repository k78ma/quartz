I've been working hard lately to get better at certain things. So, I've been thinking about the pursuit of excellence a lot lately. How do I get good at things? What's stopping me from getting good at things that I want to be good at? Why should I even bother? These thoughts may not necessarily well-structured, cohesive, or particularly insightful. I just be writing stuff man.
## The road and the roadblocks
### The mortifying ordeal of being known
The first and perhaps most important step of becoming good at something is *wanting* to become good at it. This requires the self-awareness that I am not currently good; in fact, you 
### Winner's games and loser's games`
In some sports, there's a concept of winner's games versus loser's games. Essentially, at different levels of aptitude, the win conditions are different. Let's take the example of badminton. At low levels, all you really have to do to win is be more consistent than your opponent in hitting over the net and inside the court; you don't win by being better, you win by sucking less (a loser's game). At high levels, everyone is consistent, so you win by hitting brilliant shots (a winner's game).

I feel that this may be bit of a false dichotomy, but the point being raised here is applicable. A huge part of becoming good at things, or at least being better than others, seems to simply be consistency. I think this applies in two ways:
- Consistently showing up and putting the work in. 
- Solidifying basics (i.e. consistently hitting over the net and inside the court).

The problem with this is its lack of sexiness. Not many people watch sports to see someone win by being more consistent – people want to see brilliant shots. The same goes for the participant; in the process of practicing, its much more enticing to work on brilliant shots and fancy technique rather than grind out the fundamentals.
### Going through the motions

### The edge of greatness, and growth rates
With a combination of dedication, the right approach, an appropriate amount of natural ability, and some luck, I think that anyone can become good at something. What isn't clear to me is how you become *great* at something. Is it just talent? Is hard work enough? I lean toward the former; it would be hard to convince me that LeBron James would be as good at basketball as he is if he was 5'3". While my glorious king has definitely worked hard to get to where is, is he the best player in the world (or at least widely regarded as such) simply because he has worked harder than every other NBA player?

In the same vein, what contributes to 

## Mirages
In Takehiko Inoue's manga *Vagabond*, the protagonist Musashi Miyamoto is single-mindedly driven by his desire to become strong. Not just strong, but the strongest – "Invincible under the Heavens" (天下無雙). Eventually, Musashi realizes that being the strongest is simply an empty title. When asked what it's like to be invincible by another swordsman, Musashi compared it to a mirage; you can see it so clearly from afar, but it fades when you get close.

My interpretation of this is that becoming good at something – in Musashi's case, the way of the sword – should not be an end in and of itself. Wanting to be good at something simply for the sake of being good at it will often lead to a sense of emptiness; why did I do this in the first place? I've found that it's more sustainable to have an external reason for becoming better at something, or have a particular goal in mind; it's also easier to set concrete goals for yourself along the way.
