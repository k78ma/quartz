Stochastic – involves some random probability.
- Ideally, a stochastic process is well-described by a random probability distribution.
- Stochastic doesn't mean completely random! It just means the outcome is picked from a probability distribution

Deterministic – outputs produce consistent results for a particular set of inputs, no random chance involved.
