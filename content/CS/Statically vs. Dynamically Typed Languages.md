**Static Typing:** Type checking at compile time
- C, C++, Java

**Dynamic Typing:** Type checking at run time
- Python, JavaScript, Perl, Ruby

A dynamically-typed language can compile even if they contain errors that will prevent the script from running properly. However, if a script written in a statically-typed language contains errors, it will fail to compile until the errors have been fixed.

Statically-typed require you to declare data types of variables before you use them:
```java | Java (Static)
int num;
num = 5;
```

Dynamically-typed do not:
```python
num = 5
```
