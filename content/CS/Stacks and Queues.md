Stacks and queues are containers â€“ abstract data types permit data storage and retrieval of items irrespective of actual content.

## Stack
- LIFO (last-in, first-out)
- Use a pointer to keep track of the top of the stack
### Operations
- Push: Insert item at the top of the stack.
	- Set the value of the pointer to the item being inserted
	- Increment pointer by 1
- Pop: Return (and remove item) at the top of the stack.
	- Decrease pointer by 1
- Example: Towers of Hanoi

## Queues
- FIFO (first-in, first-out).
	- FIFO order minimizes the *maximum* time spent waiting, but the average time will be the same whether FIFO or LIFO is used. 
- Use two pointers to keep track of the start and end of the queue
### Operations
- Enqueue: Insert item at the back of the queue.
	- Set the entry at the end pointer to the value and increase the end pointer by one.
- Dequeue: Return and remove the from item of the queue
	- Set increase the start pointer by one.
- Example: Drive-thru
- **Deque:** Double-ended queue where inserting and removing items can be done from both ends
