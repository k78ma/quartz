Chapter 1.3 of [[CS/Algorithm Design Manual (Skiena)]] - "Reasoning About Correctness"

- Show correctness through proofs
- We should try to show both correctness and *not incorrectness*

### Incorrectness
- A good way to demonstrate incorrectness is through counterexamples
	- Think small – counterexamples are often present in simple cases
	- This exhaustively – there are usually only a small number of possible instances for the first non-trivial value *n* when it comes to algorithms
	- Hunt for weakness – if the proposed algorithm is of the form “always take the biggest” (greedy algorithm), think about why this might be the wrong thing to do
	- Go for a tie – break greedy heuristics by providing instances where everything is the same size
	- Seek extremes  – usually easy to reason about
