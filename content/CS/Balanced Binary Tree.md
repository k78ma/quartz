Every node in a balanced binary tree meets the condition that the height difference of the left and right subtree of the node is not more than 1. Searching, insertion, and deletion in a balanced binary tree takes `O(log n)` instead of `O(n)` in an unbalanced binary tree.

Types of balanced binary trees:
- [[Red-black trees]]
- [[AVL trees]]
