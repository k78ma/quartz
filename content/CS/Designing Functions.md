Qualities of good functions:
- *Atomic:* Each function should have exactly one job, which should be identifiable with a short name and characterizable in a single line of text.
- *Abstract:* Multiple fragments of code should not describe the same logic. Instead, that logic should be implemented once, given a name, and applied multiple times. Look for opportunities for functional abstraction.
- *General:* Functions should be defined generally; for example, squaring is not a function in Python because it is a special case of `pow`, which raises numbers to arbitrary powers.
