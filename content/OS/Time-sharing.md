Method of virtualization (CPU).

By running one [[Process]], stopping it and running another, and so on, the OS can promote the illusion that many virtual CPUs exist when thereâ€™s actually only one
- Cost = performance; each process runs slower if CPU is shared
- Counterpart: space-sharing, where a resource is divided in space among those who wish to use it
	- Ex. Disk space is a naturally space-shared resource
