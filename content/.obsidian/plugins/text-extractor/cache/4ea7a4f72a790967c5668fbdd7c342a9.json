(b) Once the location of A is chosen, B must lie on a circle of radius d4p centered at A. Once the location of B is chosen, C must lie at the intersection of circles centered at A and B. Only one of these two intersections corresponds to the “heads up” configuration. (c¢) The configuration of a coin in three-dimensional space is given by the three coordinates of A, two angles to the point B on the sphere of radius dap centered at A, and one angle to the point C on the circle defined by the intersection of the a sphere centered at A and a sphere centered at B.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":"eng"}
