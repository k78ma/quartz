### Ideal World of Forms:

>[!info] Basic Idea of World of Forms
>- When you're studying geometry, there is the concept of a perfect triangle; however, this doesn't exist in real life. Naturally occurring imperfect triangles are flawed representations of that ideal perfect triangle (kind of like [[Abstraction]] in concept?). 
>- A bonsai tree and an apple tree are very different, but you recognize them to be the same â€” there is a certain tree-ness characteristic that unites them.
>- Thus, Plato posits that the world we live in is an imperfect reflection of the true world of forms
