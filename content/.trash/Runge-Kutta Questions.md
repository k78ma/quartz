- The constants for 4th-order RK were given in your slides. Are we we expected to just know these? Do we know how to derive RK constants using the Taylor Series?

- There can be an infinite number of versions. How do you quantify or determine the best set of constants?

- You said that 4th-order Runge-Kutta is the most commonly used. Why is this? Is it just a good balance between complexity and accuracy?
