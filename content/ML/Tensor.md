Tensors are algebraic objects describes a multilinear relationship between sets of algebraic objects related to a vector space.

The simple way to think about it is that tensors generalize scalars, vectors, and matrices:
- A scalar is a 0th-order tensor
- A vector is a 1st-order tensor
- A matrix is a 2nd-order tensor
