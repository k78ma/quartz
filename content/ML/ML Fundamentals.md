Never a bad idea to brush up my ML/DL fundamentals; trying to rebuild my knowledge from the ground up in a Feynman-like way. Notes are mostly from [MIT 6.036x](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.036+1T2019/course/), [Understanding Deep Learning](https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/) and [Deep Learning - Foundations and Concepts](https://www.bishopbook.com/)
