Given an MDP, our goal is typically to find a policy that is optimal in the sense that it gets as much total reward as possible, in expectation over the stochastic transitions that the domain makes. In this section, we will consider the case where there is a finite horizon H, indicating the total number of steps of interaction that the agent will have with the MDP.
