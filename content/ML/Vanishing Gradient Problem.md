This is a common problem – side effect of [[Backpropagation]].

The gradient is the slope of the loss function along the error curve. 
- When the gradient is too small, it continues to become smaller, updating the weight parameters until they become insignificant, which means that the algorithm is no longer learning. 
- Exploding gradients occur when the gradient is too large, creating an unstable model (NaN results).
