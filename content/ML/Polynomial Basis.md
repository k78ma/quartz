Systematic strategy for constructing a feature space if features are are naturally numerical

>[!note] General idea
>If you are using $k$th-order basis (where $k$ is a positive integer), you include a feature for every possible product of $k$ different dimensions in your original input.

Example: XOR problem using a polynomial basis as a feature transformation

>[!example] XOR with feature transformation 
>Letâ€™s say $k=2$ for the XOR problem in 2 dimensions.

>The feature transform is:
>$$\phi((x_{1}, x_{2})) = (1, x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{1}^{2}, x_{1}x_{2}, x_{2}^2)$$

>After training a perceptron for 4 iterations, we have:
>$$\theta = (0,0,0,0,4,0)$$
>$$\theta_{0} = 0$$
>which corresponds to
>$$0 + 0x_{1} + 0x_{2} + 0x_{1}^{2} + 4x_{1}x_{2} + 0x_{2}^{2}+ 0 = 0$$
