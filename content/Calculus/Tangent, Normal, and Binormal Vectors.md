Given $\vec{r}(t)$, the derivative $\vec{r}'(t)$ is the tangent vector.
The tangent line to $\vec{r}(t)$ at $P$ is the line passing through P and parallel to $\vec{r}(t)$.
Note that $\vec{r}'(t) \neq 0$ (vectors must have magnitude)

**Tangent vector:** 
$$
\vec{r}'(t)
$$
**Unit tangent vector:** 
$$
\vec{T}(t)= \frac{\vec{r}'(t)}{\mid\mid \vec{r}'(t)\mid\mid}
$$
- Tangent to curve with magnitude 1

**Unit normal vector:**
$$
\vec{N}(t)=\frac{\vec{T}'(t)}{\mid \mid {T}(t)\mid \mid}
$$
- Orthogonal to $\vec{T}$ (hence also orthogonal to original curve $\vec{r}(t)$)

**Binormal vector**:
$$
\vec{B}(t)= \vec{T}(t)\times \vec{N}(t)
$$
- Orthogonal to both the tangent and normal vector (definition of cross product basically)
