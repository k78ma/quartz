Suppose we have a **normal vector** that is orthogonal to the plane $\vec{n} = \langle a,b,c \rangle$
For points $P_{0}= (x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0})$ and $P=(x,y,z)$ on the plane, let $\vec{r_{0}}$ and $\vec{r}$ be position vectors for $P_0$ and $P$.
Then, vector $\vec{r} - \vec{r_0}$ lies on the plane.

## Vector Equation of Plane
Since $\vec{n}$ is normal, by the properties of dot product we have: 
$$
\begin{align}
\vec{n} \cdot (\vec{r}-\vec{r_{0}})= 0 \\
A(x-x_{0})+B(y-y_{0})+C(z-z_{0})=0 \\
\langle A,B,C \rangle \cdot \langle x-x_{0},y-y_{0},z-z_{0} \rangle=0  
\end{align}
$$
We can also use:
$$\vec{n} \cdot \vec{r} = \vec{n} \cdot \vec{r_0}$$
## Scalar Equation of Plane
A more useful form:
$$
\begin{align}
\langle a,b,c \rangle \cdot (\langle x,y,z \rangle - \langle x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0} \rangle) &= 0 \\
\langle a,b,c \rangle \cdot \langle x - x_{0}, y - y_{0}, z - z_{0} \rangle &= 0 \\
a (x - x_{0}) + b (y - y_{0}) +c( z - z_{0}) &= 0 \\
ax + by + cz &= d
\end{align}
$$

Here, $d = ax_{0}+ by_{0} + cz_{0}$.
This equation gives us the normal vector easily because $\vec{n}=\langle a,b,c \rangle$
