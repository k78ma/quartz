Multi-variable functions have differentials just like single-variable functions do. 

Given the function $z=f(x,y)$ the differential $dz$ or $df$ is given by: 
$$
dz = f_{x}dx + f_{y}dy \quad \text{ or } \quad df = f_{x}dx + f_{y}dy
$$
Given the function $w = g(x,y,z)$, the differential is given by: 
$$
dw = g_{x}dx + g_{y}dy + g_{z}dz
$$
