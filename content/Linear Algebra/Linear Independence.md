Can we solve $$Ax = b$$
for every possible vector $b$?

If the answer is no, $A$ is a singular matrix.
	For a column vectors are linearly dependent.
	- One or more of the column vectors can be expressed as a linear combination of the others
	- Linear combinations of the column vectors do not fill the whole space
