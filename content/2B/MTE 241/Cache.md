A cache is a small, very fast memory that stores frequently used results. Basically, if you’re using the same data over and over again, you can speed up access by putting it somewhere that’s easier to access.

In a simple model of the CPU we have a processor, a small cache, and a larger memory, and a circuit called the “cache controller” that manages the cache.
