Data is transferred over wires.
The set of wires dedicated to a particular type of data transfer is called a “bus”:
- Data bus (D-Bus, transfer data to/from memory)
- Address bus (select an address for read/write)
- Instruction bus (I-Bus, transfer code but not data)
- System bus (S-Bus, control circuitry, especially peripherals, sometimes data transfer)
