## Basic Surfaces
### Circular Cylinder
Equations of the form
$$
(x-x_{0})^{2}+(y-y_{0})^{2}=r^{2}
$$
define a circular cylinder with central line $(x_{0},y_{0},z)$ and radius $r$.

In 3D, any closed curve of the form $f(x,y)=0$ will give a cylinder with a different cross-section.

### Planes
$$
ax+by+cz = d
$$
for some $a,b,c,d \in \mathbb{R}$.

### Sphere
$$
(x-x_{0})+(y-y_{0})+(z-z_{0})^2=r^{2}
$$
The sphere will be centered at $(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})$ with some radius $\mid {r} \mid$.

### Paraboloids
$$
z=a(x-x_{0})^{2}+b(y-y_{0})^{2}+c
$$
where $a,b$ have the same sign. Paraboloids are basically just 3D parabolas (kinda look like a parachutes)

## Complex Surfaces

In 2D, a quadratic form is an equation of the form $a(x-x_{0})^{2}+b(y-y_{0})^{2}=c$, which describe circles/ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas, depending on the relative values of the parameters of the equation.

In 3D there are more classifications:
