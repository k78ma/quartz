### 1D Limit
We say 
$$
\lim_{ x \to x_{0} }f(x)=L
$$ 
exactly when for every $\epsilon > 0$, there is $\delta > 0$ such that whenever $\mid x-x_{0} \mid < \delta$ it follows that $\mid f(x)-L \mid < \epsilon$.

Recall: for the limit to exist, the left and right hand limits must exist and be the same.

### 2D Limit
We say 
$$
\lim_{ x,y \to x_{0},y_{0} }f(x,y)=L
$$ 
exactly when for every $\epsilon > 0$, there is a $\delta>0$ such that whenever $\sqrt{ (x-x_{0})^{2}+(y-y_{0})^{2} } < \delta$ and $(x,y)$ is in the domain of $f$, it follows that $\mid f(x)-L < \epsilon \mid$.
