Recall the 3D Cartesian Coordinate System:

We use right-handed coordinate systems:

Try to keep these axes in this orientation, or answers may come out negative.

>[!info] Definition: Octants
>We split 3D Cartesian space into 8 regions called octants.
>- Analogous to quadrants for 2D Cartesian space.

>Octants are collections of points $(x,y,z)$ where $x,y,z$ have some given signs.
>- First octant is the region where $x,y,z$ are positive. ^zyeuan
