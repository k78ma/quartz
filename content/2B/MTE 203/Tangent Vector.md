### Tangent Vector
If $\vec{r}(t)=\langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \rangle$ for $\alpha \leq t \leq \beta$ is the vector representation of a curve $C$, then at any point on $C$ at which $x'(t), y'(t), z'(t)$ all exist and do not simultaneously vanish, we have:
$$
\vec{T}=\vec{r}'
$$
as a tangent vector to $C$.

>[!info] Direction
>$\vec{T}$ for a vector function $\vec{r}(t)$ always points in the direction in which the parameter $t$ increases along $C$.

### Unit Tangent Vector
Tangent vector with length 1, denoted by $\hat{T}(t)$, such that:
$$
\hat{T}(t)=\frac{\vec{T}}{\mid \mid \vec{T} \mid \mid}=\frac{\vec{r}'(t)}{\mid \mid  \vec{r}'(t) \mid \mid} = \frac{\frac{ d\vec{r} }{ dt } }{\mid \mid \frac{ d\vec{r} }{ dt }  \mid \mid}
$$
