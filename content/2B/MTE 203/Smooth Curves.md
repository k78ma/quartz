### Smooth Curve
A curve $C$ parametrized by $\vec{r}(t)=\langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \rangle$ for $\alpha \leq t \leq \beta$, is said to be a **smooth curve** if: 
- The derivatives $x'(t), y'(t), z'(t)$ are all continuous for all $\alpha \leq t \leq \beta$
- The derivatives $x'(t), y'(t), z'(t)$ do not simultaneously vanish for $\alpha \leq t \leq \beta$

### Piecewise-Smooth Curve
A curve $C$ is a **piecewise-smooth curve** if it is continuous and can be divided into a finite number of smooth subcurves.
