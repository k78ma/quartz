Suppose $x_{0}, y_{0}$ is a critical point of $f(x,y)$ where both partial derivatives vanish. Further suppose that $f_{x}, f_{y}, f_{xx}, f_{xy}, f_{yy}$ are all continuous. Define:
$$
A = f_{xx}(x_{0},y_{0}), \quad B = f_{xy}(x_{0},y_{0}), \quad C = f_{yy}(x_{0},y_{0})
$$
Then, we have:
- If $B^{2} - AC < 0$ and $A<0$ then $f(x,y)$ has a relative maximum at $(x_{0},y_{0})$
- If $B^{2} - AC < 0$ and $A>0$ then $f(x,y)$ has a relative minimum at $(x_{0},y_{0})$
- If $B^{2} - AC > 0$ then $f(x,y)$ has a saddle point at $(x_{0},y_{0})$
- If $B^{2} - AC = 0$ then no conclusion can be made
