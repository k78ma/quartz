Sensor linearity is the straightness of a sensor's input-output relationship compared to a perfectly straight line.

This is usually expressed as a percentage of full scale. The straight line is usually a best-fit straight line (BFSL), instead of simply connecting the endpoints.

For a straight line $y=mx+b$, we would have:
- $y$ is the output
- $m$ is the sensitivity
- $x$ is the input
- $b$ is the offset

Usually expressed as percentage of full scale.
