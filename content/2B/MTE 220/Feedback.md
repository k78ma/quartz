Feedback is when the output of a system is applied to the input. 

**Open-loop:** Absence of feedback, no pathway from output to input.
- Simple but can be sub-optimal.
- Example: turning a car with your eyes closed by holding the steering wheel at a fixed angle for a specific amount of time does turn the car, but not safely or predictably.

**Closed-loop negative feedback:** Seeks to minimize the error between reference and measured signals.
- Example: A fridge door closes itself by applying a force proportional to how open the door is (the force *decreases* as the door closes).
- A driver turns a car with their eyes open until it is pointing in the desired direction (the driver *reduces* the steering wheel angle as the complete the turn.)

**Closed-loop positive feedback:** Causes the output to “stick” to one extreme and resist changing states.
- Example: Cabinet door with magnet keeps it stuck shut (magnet force *increases* as the door closes).
