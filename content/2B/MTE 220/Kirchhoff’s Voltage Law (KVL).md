The sum of all the voltages around a closed path equals zero. Imagine going for a walk with changing elevation (voltage) along the way. When you return to your starting point, your elevation must also return to its starting value.

Similarly, the voltage along a circuit path increases or decreases; and the voltage increases and decreases must cancel when returning to the starting node.
