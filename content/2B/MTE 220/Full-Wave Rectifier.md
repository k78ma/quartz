A full-wave rectifier converts AC to DC like a [[Half-Wave Rectifier]] but does a better job. This is also called a bridge rectifier.

Four diodes route the positive and negative parts of the AC input through the load in the same direction. Again, we can add a big capacitor to smooth out the signal.

Here are the paths for the current to flow. The left case (a) is when $V_{AC}$ is positive, the right case is when it is negative. Note that the current flows through the load in the same direction both ways.
