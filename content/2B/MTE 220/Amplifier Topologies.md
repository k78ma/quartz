We can model 4 types of amplifiers using dependent sources:

The above figures use two-port notation with currents flowing into the positive terminals.
When an amplifier outputs current, such as the transconductance and current amplifiers, the current is often referenced as leaving the positive terminal since that is often how the circuit is configured to operate.
