Inductors use current through a coiled wire to store energy as a magnetic field. The energy is returned when applied current drops. Inductors develop a voltage that resists instantaneous changes in current.

The voltage is proportional to the change in current. This proportionality is called the **inductance** ($L \; [H]$), such that:
$$
V=L\frac{ dI }{ dt } 
$$
This is analogous to Newtonâ€™s 2nd law: $V$ is a force pushing the current, which is opposed by $L$. A large mass (big $L$) accelerates less ($\frac{dI}{dt}$). A small mass ($L$) accelerates more.
