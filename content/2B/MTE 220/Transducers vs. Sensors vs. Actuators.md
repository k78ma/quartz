Clarification of terminology.

Transducers are devices that convert energy from one domain, $x$, to another, $y$.
- For example, a piezoelectric material has a voltage difference between its surfaces proportional to a given strain.

Transducers can be **sensors**, **actuators**, or indicators
- Sensors produce signals that represent measured physical values.
- Actuators and indicators produce some action based on an applied signal.
