Battery packs combine battery cells in series and parallel to increase the available energy.

$N$ cells in series gives higher voltage:
- $V_{total} = NV_{cell}$. $Q_{total} = Q_{cell}$ and $C_{total} = C_{cell}$ remain the same.

$M$ cells in series gives more voltage: 
- $Q_{total} = MQ_{cell}$ and $C_{total} = C_{cell}$.
- $V_{total} = V_{cell}$ remains the same.

We can apply both approaches together to achieve:
$$
E_{total} = (MQ_{cell})(NV_{cell})
$$
