There are several approaches to measuring capacitance
- Oscillator based: Usually the frequency of oscillation is proportional to the inverse of some time constant ($f_{osc}\propto \frac{1}{\tau}$) or proportional to the square root of some $LC$ such that $f_{osc} \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{ LC }}$
- Charge-based
- Wheatstone bridge (AC)
