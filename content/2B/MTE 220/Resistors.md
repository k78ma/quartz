A resistor opposes the flow of current like a restrictive pipe for fluid flow. As such, it determines how hard you need to push ($V$) to get charge to flow at a desired rate ($I$).

The inverse of resistance is **conductance**:
$$
G= \frac{1}{R} \quad\left[ S = \frac{A}{V} \right]
$$

### Adding Resistors
Resistors in series add:
$$
R_{eq}=R_{1}+R_{2}
$$
Resistors in parallel add as inverses:
$$
\frac{1}{R_{eq}}=\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}
$$
This is equivalent to saying conductances in parallel add: $G_{eq}=G_{1}+G_{2}$
