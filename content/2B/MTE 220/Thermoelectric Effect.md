The principle behind this is that a temperature difference leads to a voltage.

- **Seebeck effect:** $\Delta T \to e^{-}$ from hot to cold, which results in $\Delta V$
- **Peltier effect:** When there is a function of different materials, running a current through the junction causes $e^{-} / h^{+}$ pairs to generate or recombine. This will either release or absorb heat due to the momentum change required for $e^{-} / h^{+}$ generation/recombination
- **Thomson effect:** Creating $\Delta T$ in a material, we cause a Peltier effect across the gradient.
