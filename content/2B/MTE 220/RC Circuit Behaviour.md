Given the formula for time constant delay defined in [[RC Formulation]], we can model the voltage in a RC circuit as an exponential curve:

>As a rule, we consider $V(t)$ to be zero after 5$\tau$, even if this is not mathematically true. This is also true for charging instead of discharging â€“ something is fully charged after $5\tau$.



The whole point of this is that the curve behaves the same for any $\tau$, but you can pick and choose the $\tau$ value by choosing values for $R$ and $C$.
