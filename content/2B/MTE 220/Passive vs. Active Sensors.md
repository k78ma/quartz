## Passive

![[Passive vs. Active Sensors.png|388]]

A physical values, $x$, changes a passive property of the device, $f(x)$. For example:
- Resistance
- Capacitance
- Inductance
- Other passive properties: mass, inertia, optical density, etc.

This then requires conversion to a voltage or current signal, $y$ (signal conditioning). Passive sensor modules can include integrated signal conditioning.

## Active

![[Passive vs. Active Sensors-1.png|365]]

A physical effect creates an output signal voltage or current, $y$, directly from a physical value, $x$. Some physics principle couples $x$ and $y$. 

For example, piezoelectric material relates mechanical strain and voltage. This may require external power to function.
