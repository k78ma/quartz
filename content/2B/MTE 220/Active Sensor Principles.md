Active sensors rely on physics principles that couple sensor input and the electrical domain, possibly through intermediate domains.

Some common effects used in active sensors:
- [[Hall Effect]]
- [[Electromagnetic Effect]]
- [[Thermoelectric Effect]]
- [[Piezoelectric Effect]]
- [[Photoelectric Effect]]
- [[Photovoltaic Effect]]
