Capacitors store energy in the electrostatic field of charge ($Q \;[C]$) on conductive plates separated by a distance.

Applying a voltage, $V_{c}(t)$ forces a proportional charge imbalance of $Q$. This is analogous to storing energy in a stretched spring or placing a stretchy balloon membrane in a pipe. 

This proportionality is called the **capacitance** ($C \; [F]$) and states how much charge, $Q$, is pushed onto the capacitor for a given voltage, $V$:
$$
Q=CV
$$
Taking the time derivative of both sides gives an $I-V$ relationship:
$$
I = C \frac{ dV }{ dt } 
$$
A bigger capacitor can store more $Q$ for a given $V$.
- Analogy: A bike tire has more less air ($Q$) for a given pressure ($V$) versus a bouncy castle, which has significantly more air; so, the bike tire has less capacitance than the bouncy castle.
