We have enough building blocks to do frequency-domain filtering, including amplifying some frequencies and attenuating others.
- $0 < \text{Gain} < 1$ using voltage divider
- $\text{Gain} < 0$ or $\text{Gain} > 1$ using op-amps
- Low-pass or high-pass filters using L and C
- Multiply frequency response by putting building blocks in series
- Add signals using op-amps
