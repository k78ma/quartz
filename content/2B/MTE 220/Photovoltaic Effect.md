Principle: When light is absorbed, electrons or other charge carriers ($h^{+}$ ) become excited. The distinction between this and the [[Photoelectric Effect]] is that electrons are ejected in the photoelectric effect but remain in the material here.

Applications: Energy production, light sensors, photodiodes, imaging
Use cases: Solar panels, digital cameras
