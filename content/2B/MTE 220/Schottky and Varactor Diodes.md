#### Schottky diode
- Metal-semiconductor junction
- Lower $V_{F}$ than PN diode
- Higher reverse (leakage current)
- Use this if we want something that turns on quickly and don't care about leakage.

#### Varactor Diodes:
- Depletion layer is like a parallel-plate capacitor
- Varactor uses this effect to act as a voltage-controlled capacitor
- Usually operated in reverse bias

- Recall parallel plate cap from high school:
$$
C= \frac{\epsilon A}{d}
$$
where $d$ is a depletion region, width changes with $V_{R}$ reverse bias
