Doing things in the time domain has a lot of calculus, which inhibits insight and analysis. The frequency/Fourier domain (impedance) simplifies things for linear systems. However, it has a lot of imaginary $j$'s that complicate the expressions. Furthermore, sinusoids go on forever, but real signals and systems don't.
