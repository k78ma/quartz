Transfer functions are a general way to relate one state to another â€“ similar to gain for [[Op-amps]] and [[Sensor Transfer Function]].

For example, for a voltage divider, the transfer function would be:
$$
\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} = \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} \quad [\text{V}/\text{V}]
$$
Applies to linear systems.
