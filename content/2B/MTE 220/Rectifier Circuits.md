This is a AC/DC for [[Power Conditioning Circuits|power conditioning]]. It's the same as a [[Full-Wave Rectifier]] covered in Diodes.

Usually, we use a four-diode bridge rectifier. Sometimes, this may be preceded by a transformer to drop the line voltage.

Using a bigger "bulk decoupling" $C_{L}$ to reduce the $V_{r}$ ripple voltage.
