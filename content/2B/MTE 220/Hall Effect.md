Current runs through a long conductor. An external magnetic field pushes moving charges against one side or the other. Then, the difference in potential at surfaces is related to the applied magnetic field.
$$
\text{Magnetic field} \to \text{Force} \to \text{Voltage}
$$
Applications: Proximity sensing, positioning, speed detection, current sensing.
Use cases: Car shaft speed sensors, power supply current sensors, brushless DC electric motor.
