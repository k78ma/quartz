Fundamentally this is just Faraday's Law I think?

The principle is electromagnetic induction; a changing magnetic flux results in a voltage, such that:
$$
V = -\frac{d\Phi_{B}}{dt}
$$
where $\Phi_{B}$ is the B-field passing through an area.

Applications: Proximity/position sensing, EM field sensing.
Use cases: Antennas, motion control, traffic sensing, spring compression sensing, flow and level sensing.
