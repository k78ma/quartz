**Analog:** Signal that can take on any value in a continuous range (amplitude can be infinite number of values).
- Often confused with continuous time but not the same!

**Digital:** Signal that can only take on a finite number of values. 
- For example, a binary signal is digital because it can only take 0 or 1.
- Often confused with discrete time but not the same!

[[Continuous Time and Discrete Time Signals]] qualify the nature of the signal along the horizontal (time) axis.
Analog and Digital qualify the nature of the signal amplitude (vertical axis).
