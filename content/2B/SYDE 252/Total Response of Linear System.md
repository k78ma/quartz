The system output for $t\geq 0$ is a result of two independent causes:
1. System state at time $t=0$ (initial condition).
2. The output $x(t)$ for $t\geq 0$.

Thus, we have:
$$
\text{Total response} = \text{Zero-input response} + \text{Zero-state response}
$$
where:
- ZIR is response due to the initial conditions at $t=0$ with zero input
- ZSR is response due to the input $x(t)$ for $t \geq 0$ when initial condition is zero
