- A signal is anything that carries information or data themselves
- Signals are functions of independent variables
	- Ex: Speech is a function of time
	- Ex: An image is a 2D function of spatial variables $x$ and $y$ (basically a matrix/grid)

In [[2B/SYDE 252/Signals and Systems|SYDE 252]], we only deal with signals that are functions of time.
