Convergence cases:

Divergence cases:

- Converges when $|g'(x)| < 1$
- Diverges when $|g'(x)| \geq 1$

Convergence occurs when the absolute value of the slope $f_{2}(x) = g(x)$ is less than the slope of $f_{1}(x) =x$. Basically the idea here is that if the curve changes to fast relative to the isolated $f_{1}(x) =x$ function, the two curves diverge since the iterations are no longer moving toward the $y=x$ line.
