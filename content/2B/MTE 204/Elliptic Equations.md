Elliptic equations represent steady state problems, such as temperature distribution in plate or rod, after sufficient time elapses to achieve steady state.

### Heated Plate Example

The [[Laplaceâ€™s Equation]] is used here:
$$
\frac{ \partial^{2}T }{ \partial x^{2} } + \frac{ \partial^{2}T }{ \partial y^{2} } =0
$$
