Make a plot of function and observe where it crosses the $x$-axis.

For example, to find the roots of:
$$
f(x)=3x^{2}+4x+1
$$

We can first find its minimum at $f'(x)=0$ and finding that $x=-2 / 3$ for this minimum point. We also observe from the graph that it crosses the horizontal axis at $x = -1, -1 / 3$. 

This basic graphical method is useful for predicting the number of roots and their approximate location, which can serve as a useful starting point for analysis.

#### Rules of Thumb
Here are some rules of thumb for root prediction based on graphical methods:

- If $f(x_{i})$ and $f(x_{i+1})$ have the same sign, interval has no roots **(a)** or an even number of roots **(c)**
-  If $f(x_{i})$ and $f(x_{i+1})$ have the different signs, there is at least one root **(b)** or an odd number of roots **(d)**

- Exceptions: 
	- $f(x)$ is tangent to the $x$-axis as minimum or maximum
	- Function of discontinuous
	- Even number of roots in both cases
