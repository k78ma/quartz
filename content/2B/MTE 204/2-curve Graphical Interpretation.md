Since we are isolating $x$ for open methods (see [[Fixed point iteration#^6e35b2|here on transforming equations for fixed point iteration]]), these functions can be thought of as two curves. Using the function used above as an example, we would have:
$$
\begin{align}
f_{1}(x) &= e^{-x} \\
f_{2}(x)&=x
\end{align}
$$
