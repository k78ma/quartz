Welcome to my notes!
- I take notes here to learn more efficiently and track my knowledge, and figured there's not much downside to publishing them online as they may be useful to others. 
- Some links will not work â€” either the note is private or doesn't exist yet.
- Notes are taken with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md); site is published using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz).

\*The site is named "Cortex" for three reasons:
- The term "second brain" is popular with people who use Obsidian to take notes
- The behavior tree used at [Polymath Robotics](https://polymathrobotics.com/), where I interned, is called Cortex
- It sounds cool
