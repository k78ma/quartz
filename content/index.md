Welcome to my notes!
- I take notes here (started July 2023) to learn more efficiently and track my knowledge, and figured there's not much downside to publishing them online as they may be useful to others. 
- Some links will not work â€” either the note is private or doesn't exist yet.
- Notes are taken with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md); site is published using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz).
