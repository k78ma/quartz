There are several transformations in the 3D space, with the [[Euclidean Transformation]] being the simplest. The Euclidean transformation keeps the vectorâ€™s length and angle, which is equivalent to moving or rotating a rigid body without changing its appearance. The other transformations will change their shape, and they all have similar matrix representations.

- [[Similarity Transformation]]
- [[Affine Transformation]]
- [[Perspective Transformation]]
