>[!info] Definition: Degrees of Freedom (DOF)
>Smallest number of real-valued coordinates needed to represent configuration.

- Ex. Configuration of a door can be represented by a single $\theta$ representing the hinge angle
	- 1 DOF
- Ex. Configuration of a point on a plane can be represented by $(x,y)$
	- 2 DOF
- Ex. Configuration of a coin lying on a plane can be represented by $(x,y,\theta)$ for location & orientation
	- 3 DOF + 1 discrete variable representing which side is facing up

General rule for determining the number of DOF of a system:
$$
\text{degrees of freedom} = (\text{sum of freedom of the points}) - (\text{number of independent constraints}
)
$$
This can also be expressed in terms of the number of variables and independent equations that describe the system:
$$
\text{degrees of freedom = (number of variables) - (number of independent equations)}
$$
A rigid body in 3D space (spatial rigid body) has 6 DOF.
A rigid body in 2D space (planar rigid body) has 3 DOF.
In terms of rigid bodies, we can express the above equations as:
$$
\text{degrees of freedom} = (\text{sum of freedom of the bodies}) - (\text{number of independent constraints})
$$

>Let’s continue with the example of a coin lying on the table:
>- Choose 3 points $A, B, C$.
>- For a coordinate frame $xy$ is used to describe the plane, the positions of these points in the $(x_{A}, y_{A})$, $(x_{B},y_{B})$, and $(x_{C}, y_{C})$.
>- If the points could be placed anywhere on the plane, the coin would have 6 DOF (two for each of the three points).
>- However, the coins are a rigid body, so the distance between point $A$ and $B$ ($d(A,B)$) is always constant regardless of where the coin is.
>- $d(A,B)$, $d(B,C)$ and $d(A,C)$ must be constrained too:
>$$
>d(A,B) = \sqrt{(x_A-x_{B})^{2}+(y_{A}-y_{B})^{2}} = d_{AB}
>$$
>$$
>d(B,C) = \sqrt{(x_B-x_{C})^{2}+(y_{B}-y_{C})^{2}} = d_{BC}
>$$
>$$
>d(A,C) = \sqrt{(x_A-x_{C})^{2}+(y_{A}-y_{C})^{2}} = d_{AC}
>$$
>- Keeping these constraints in mind, we can find the DOF of the coin on the table.
>	- First choosing the position of point $A$, we can choose it to be any point we want $(x_{A},y_{A})$.
>	- We $(x_{A},y_{A})$ is specified, $d_{AB}$ restricts the choice of point $B$ $(x_{B},y_{B})$ to those points on the circle of radius $d_{AB}$ centered at $A$.
>		- A point on this circle can be specified by a single parameter – $\phi_{AB}$, the angle specifying the location of B on the circle centered at $A$.
>		- We can define it to be the angle that the vector $\vec{AB}$ makes with the $x$-axis.
	>- Once we have chosen $B$, there are only two possible locations for $C$ – at the intersections of the circle of radius $d_{AC}$ centered at $A$ and the circle of radius $d_{BC}$ centered at $B$.
	>	- These two locations correspond to heads/tails.
	>- Thus, once $A$ , $B$, and heads/tails has been chosen, the constraint of $d_{AC}$ and $d_{BC}$ eliminate the apparent freedoms provided by $(x_{C}, y_{C})$, fixing the location of C.
	>- Thus, the coin only has ***3 DOF*** specified by $(x_{A}, y_{A}, \phi_{AB})$.
>- Suppose we want to specify a 4th point $D$ on the coin.
>	- This introduces constraints $d_{AD}, d_{BD}, d_{CD}$.
>	- One of these constraints is redundant – only 2 can be independent.
>	- The two freedoms apparently introduced by $(x_{D},y_{D})$ are then immediately eliminated by these two independent constraints.
>	- The same would be true for any other point we want to add so there is no need to consider additional points
