A closed-chain mechanism is any mechanism that has a closed loop
- Example: A person standing with both feet on the ground is an example of a closed-chain mechanism, since a closed loop can be traced from the: ground → right leg → waist → left leg

Open-chain is any mechanism without a close loop; an example is your arm when your hand is allowed to move freely in space
