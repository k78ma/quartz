The general idea of this project is to automate tasks using a Cohere LLM to create applets, save these applets and let them be used in a user-friendly way.

### Step 1: Automate tasks with using code generation

- Examples: 
	- “Text Zara and ask what I missed in class today and email TA about absence“
	- “Make a GUI to with a counter that can be incremented/decremented”
- Prompt is fed to LLM, which writes code and test cases for itself
- Iterative prompting for self-debugging: if there are errors or failed tests, the LLM prompts itself again with the original prompt AND the error message
- Once errors are resolved, the applet prototype is shown to the user for approval
	- User can give feedback like “this is not what I want it to do” or “please make the GUI pink instead”, at which point the LLM will prompt itself again with (original prompt + code + feedback) to keep improving the applet
	- If the user is happy and has no feedback, the applet is finalized
- Small features that are easy:
	- Automatically name applet from prompt
- Nice-to-have fancy features:
	- Virtual environment creation with dependencies for each applet’s needs
	- Fancy skill-building shit ([Voyager](https://github.com/MineDojo/Voyager))

### Step 2: Applet Dashboard
- Since the applets are just code generated by LLM, they are easy to save – just save the code into a directory
- Make sure code is in executable format (easy with Python code)
- For every code file/applet in the directory, make a button on a dashboard; when the user presses the button, the applet runs
- Dashboard can be a web app or a desktop app, maybe even mobile

### Step 3: Sharing
- Crowdsourced app store platform (social media???)
- If you create an applet that you like and think other people would find useful, you can upload it to the platform
- Then, other users can download applets from the platform
- (This is just GitHub basically lol)
- Nice-to-have fancy features:
	- Semantic search of applets in the store

### Some notes:
- The bottleneck of what our system can do is LLM capability
	- so if stuff doesn’t work we blame Cohere :)
- Some bullshit statements to sprinkle in:
	- “Because your generated code is saved locally, it’s personal and secure”
