- I'm not actually a big believer in note-taking as a method for learning; I think that application of ideas leads to mastery.
- Thus, my reason for taking these notes is more to *track* things I've learned, and to try to find unexpected connections between concepts (serendipity, one might say). 
- Also, having a public website with my notes serves as a forcing function to make my write more notes and publish more notes, even if no one actually reads them.
- I generally still try to make these notes somewhat high quality to maximize learning, i.e. re-writing things in my words. However, sometimes I get lazy and just copy-paste stuff (for the sake of tracking). Thus, I don't want to claim ownership on stuff here (except [[Writing]]) and you probably shouldn't cite me. I try to list sources as much as possible but am not super diligent about it.
