If the joint distribution of two variables factorizes into the product of the marginals, such that
$$
p(X,Y)=p(X)p(Y)
$$
then $X, Y$ are said to be independent. From the [[Sum and Product Rules of Probability|product rule]], this extends to give us:
$$
p(Y|X) = p(Y)
$$
Example of independent events: successive flip of a coin; previous flips has no effect on the future ones.
